## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

Problem: Airbnb hosts are required to maintain a guest satisfaction score of 4+/5. When the What aspects of a host property are the strongest predictors of a guest review being a 4 or greater (out of 5)?

Data: Airbnb data on hosts, properties, and guest reviews (scores and verbatims) for the Washington, DC market. Sourced from [**Inside Airbnb**](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html#:~:text=Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20District%20of%20Columbia%2C%20United%20States)

Methods: Classification modeling to determine the probability of a 4+/5 rating for a given property record.

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.


Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
  * Poor guest satisfaction negatively impacts revenue
    * Guests less likely to return to the property/other properties within the brand
    * Dissatisfied guests more likely to tell others about their bad experiences, decreasing the likelihood of new guests trying an Airbnb
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
    * Based on my experience in hospitality, I know that the guest's overall score is one of the top performance metrics, if not the most important
    * When I was a hotel manager, I was curious about what aspects of the guest experience had the strongest impact on their review scores.
        * The overall review scores for this dataset showed a large percentage of scores over 4.
        * I wanted to know what would be the strongest predictors of a property falling below a score of 4.
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
    * Airbnb

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.


Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
